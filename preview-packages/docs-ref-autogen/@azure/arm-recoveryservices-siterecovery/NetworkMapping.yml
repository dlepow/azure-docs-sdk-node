summary: >-
  Network Mapping model. Ideally it should have been possible to inherit this
  class from prev version in InheritedModels as long as there is no difference
  in structure or method signature. Since there were no base Models for certain
  fields and methods viz NetworkMappingProperties and Load with required return
  type, the class has been introduced in its entirety with references to base
  models to facilitate extensions in subsequent versions.
