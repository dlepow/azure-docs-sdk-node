  Defines values for Intent. \

  <xref:@azure/arm-security.KnownIntent> can be used interchangeably with
  Intent,
   this enum contains the known values that the service supports.
  ### Known values supported by the service

  **Unknown**: Unknown \

  **PreAttack**: PreAttack could be either an attempt to access a certain
  resource regardless of a malicious intent, or a failed attempt to gain access
  to a target system to gather information prior to exploitation. This step is
  usually detected as an attempt, originating from outside the network, to scan
  the target system and find a way in.  Further details on the PreAttack stage
  can be read in [MITRE Pre-Att&ck
  matrix](https:\/\/attack.mitre.org\/matrices\/pre\/). \

  **InitialAccess**: InitialAccess is the stage where an attacker manages to get
  foothold on the attacked resource. \

  **Persistence**: Persistence is any access, action, or configuration change to
  a system that gives a threat actor a persistent presence on that system. \

  **PrivilegeEscalation**: Privilege escalation is the result of actions that
  allow an adversary to obtain a higher level of permissions on a system or
  network. \

  **DefenseEvasion**: Defense evasion consists of techniques an adversary may
  use to evade detection or avoid other defenses. \

  **CredentialAccess**: Credential access represents techniques resulting in
  access to or control over system, domain, or service credentials that are used
  within an enterprise environment. \

  **Discovery**: Discovery consists of techniques that allow the adversary to
  gain knowledge about the system and internal network. \

  **LateralMovement**: Lateral movement consists of techniques that enable an
  adversary to access and control remote systems on a network and could, but
  does not necessarily, include execution of tools on remote systems. \

  **Execution**: The execution tactic represents techniques that result in
  execution of adversary-controlled code on a local or remote system. \

  **Collection**: Collection consists of techniques used to identify and gather
  information, such as sensitive files, from a target network prior to
  exfiltration. \

  **Exfiltration**: Exfiltration refers to techniques and attributes that result
  or aid in the adversary removing files and information from a target network.
  \

  **CommandAndControl**: The command and control tactic represents how
  adversaries communicate with systems under their control within a target
  network. \

  **Impact**: Impact events primarily try to directly reduce the availability or
  integrity of a system, service, or network; including manipulation of data to
  impact a business or operational process. \

  **Probing**: Probing could be either an attempt to access a certain resource
  regardless of a malicious intent, or a failed attempt to gain access to a
  target system to gather information prior to exploitation. \

  **Exploitation**: Exploitation is the stage where an attacker manages to get a
  foothold on the attacked resource. This stage is relevant for compute hosts
  and resources such as user accounts, certificates etc.
