  Defines values for RecommendationType. \

  <xref:@azure/arm-security.KnownRecommendationType> can be used interchangeably
  with RecommendationType,
   this enum contains the known values that the service supports.
  ### Known values supported by the service

  **IoT_ACRAuthentication**: Authentication schema used for pull an edge module
  from an ACR repository does not use Service Principal Authentication. \

  **IoT_AgentSendsUnutilizedMessages**: IoT agent message size capacity is
  currently underutilized, causing an increase in the number of sent messages.
  Adjust message intervals for better utilization. \

  **IoT_Baseline**: Identified security related system configuration issues. \

  **IoT_EdgeHubMemOptimize**: You can optimize Edge Hub memory usage by turning
  off protocol heads for any protocols not used by Edge modules in your
  solution. \

  **IoT_EdgeLoggingOptions**: Logging is disabled for this edge module. \

  **IoT_InconsistentModuleSettings**: A minority within a device security group
  has inconsistent Edge Module settings with the rest of their group. \

  **IoT_InstallAgent**: Install the Azure Security of Things Agent. \

  **IoT_IPFilter_DenyAll**: IP Filter Configuration should have rules defined
  for allowed traffic and should deny all other traffic by default. \

  **IoT_IPFilter_PermissiveRule**: An Allow IP Filter rules source IP range is
  too large. Overly permissive rules might expose your IoT hub to malicious
  intenders. \

  **IoT_OpenPorts**: A listening endpoint was found on the device. \

  **IoT_PermissiveFirewallPolicy**: An Allowed firewall policy was found
  (INPUT\/OUTPUT). The policy should Deny all traffic by default and define
  rules to allow necessary communication to\/from the device. \

  **IoT_PermissiveInputFirewallRules**: A rule in the firewall has been found
  that contains a permissive pattern for a wide range of IP addresses or Ports.
  \

  **IoT_PermissiveOutputFirewallRules**: A rule in the firewall has been found
  that contains a permissive pattern for a wide range of IP addresses or Ports.
  \

  **IoT_PrivilegedDockerOptions**: Edge module is configured to run in
  privileged mode, with extensive Linux capabilities or with host-level network
  access (send\/receive data to host machine). \

  **IoT_SharedCredentials**: Same authentication credentials to the IoT Hub used
  by multiple devices. This could indicate an illegitimate device impersonating
  a legitimate device. It also exposes the risk of device impersonation by an
  attacker. \

  **IoT_VulnerableTLSCipherSuite**: Insecure TLS configurations detected.
  Immediate upgrade recommended.
