      Property specifying whether protection against purge is enabled for this
      vault. Setting this property to true activates protection against purge
      for this vault and its content - only the Key Vault service may initiate a
      hard, irrecoverable deletion. The setting is effective only if soft delete
      is also enabled. Enabling this functionality is irreversible - that is,
      the property does not accept false as its value.

      in vault properties, and any policy stored on Azure Resource Manager will
      be ignored. If null or not specified, the value of this property will not
      change.
